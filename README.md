### Blockchain
# 🌀 I'm faithful that 'Blockchain' tech will be significant in the near future, based on the fact that as it has so & so much potential to transform the underlying insfrastructure of the Internet, along with the capabilities to collab with or integrated into other techs like AI ... Nevertheless, 'Blockchain' tech is still somewhat immature, just like the Internet in the early 90s. Good sign is that more & more builders are starting to realize its hidden power and helping it develop rapidly. That's why I'd love to take this chance to be a part of history. The opportunity to contribute is open for everyone.
